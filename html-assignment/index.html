            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is <em>Melvyn Fokuoh.</em> I'm a screenwriter and an aspiring web developper. I joined this program initially for design, but I have already pivoted towards programming. It has so far been my favourite course in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program and I'm hoping to learn more and advance my skills. I'm aiming to do some self-learning on the side as well.</p>
            <p>At first I was wondering why I was instantly drawn to programming, then I realized it was the same reason I love screenwriting: <sup>the creation of a blueprint.</sup> Because I'm a screenwriter, many people are surprised to hear that I don't like any other type of writing, other than music writing. All three forms are essentially a blueprint before they are consumed by people in a different form visually and/or sonically.</p>
